Notes:
    * In this implementation the ensemble is not specified. I have selected some very fast, basic classifiers.
    * Also, it is not clear what the authors mean by "weighted distance".
    * The original technique is not prepared for the case when no minority samples are classified correctly be the ensemble.

In this paper, we show that there is an inherently potential risk associated with the over-sampling algorithms in terms of the large margin principle. Then we propose a new synthetic over sampling method, named Margin-guided Synthetic Over-sampling (MSYN), to reduce this risk. The MSYN improves learning with respect to the data distributions guided by the margin-based rule. Empirical study verities the efficacy of MSYN.",

                        abstract="One solution to deal with class imbalance is to modify its class distribution. Synthetic over-sampling is a well-known method to modify class distribution by generating new synthetic minority data. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is a state-of-the-art synthetic over-sampling algorithm that generates new synthetic data along the line between the minority data and their selected nearest neighbors. Advantages of SMOTE is to have decision regions larger and less specific to original data. However, its drawback is the over-generalization problem where synthetic data is generated into majority class region. Over-generalization leads to misclassify non-minority class region into minority class. To overcome the over-generalization problem, we propose an algorithm, called TRIM, to search for precise minority region while maintaining its generalization. TRIM iteratively filters out irrelevant majority data from the precise minority region. Output of the algorithm is the multiple set of seed minority data, and each individual set will be used for generating new synthetic data. Compared with state-of-the-art over-sampling algorithms, experimental results show significant performance improvement in terms of F-measure and AUC. This suggests over-generalization has a significant impact on the performance of the synthetic over-sampling method.",

                abstract="Imbalanced data is a common problem in classification. This phenomenon is growing in importance since it appears in most real domains. It has special relevance to highly imbalanced data-sets (when the ratio between classes is high). Many techniques have been developed to tackle the problem of imbalanced training sets in supervised learning. Such techniques have been divided into two large groups: those at the algorithm level and those at the data level. Data level groups that have been emphasized are those that try to balance the training sets by reducing the larger class through the elimination of samples or increasing the smaller one by constructing new samples, known as undersampling and oversampling, respectively. This paper proposes a new hybrid method for preprocessing imbalanced data-sets through the construction of new samples, using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique together with the application of an editing technique based on the Rough Set Theory and the lower approximation of a subset. The proposed method has been validated by an experimental study showing good results using C4.5 as the learning algorithm.",

                }

Notes:
    * I think the description of the algorithm in Fig 5 of the paper is not correct. The set "resultSet" is initialized with the original instances, and then the While loop in the Algorithm run until resultSet is empty, which never holds. Also, the resultSet is only extended in the loop. Our implementation is changed in the following way: we generate twice as many instances are required to balance the dataset, and repeat the loop until the number of new samples added to the training set is enough to balance the dataset.

Synthetic oversampling methods address this problem by generating new synthetic minority class samples. To distribute the synthetic samples effectively, recent approaches create weight values for original minority samples based on their importance and distribute synthetic samples according to weight values. However, most of the existing algorithms create inappropriate weights and in many cases, they cannot generate the required weight values for the minority samples. This results in a poor distribution of generated synthetic samples. In this respect, this paper presents a new synthetic oversampling algorithm, Proximity Weighted Synthetic Oversampling Technique (ProWSyn). Our proposed algorithm generate effective weight values for the minority data samples based on sample's proximity information, i.e., distance from boundary which results in a proper distribution of generated synthetic samples across the minority data set. Simulation results on some real world datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed method showing improvements in various assessment metrics such as AUC, F-measure, and G-mean.",

Notes:
    * This implementation is only a rough estimation of the method described in the paper. The main problem is that the paper uses many datasets to find similar patterns in the codebooks and replicate patterns appearing in other datasets to the imbalanced datasets based on their relative position compared to the codebook elements. What we do is clustering the minority class to extract a codebook as kmeans cluster means, then, find pairs of codebook elements which have the most similar relative position to a randomly selected pair of codebook elements, and translate nearby minority samples from the neighborhood one pair of codebook elements to the neighborood of another pair of codebook elements.

                abstract="The problem of modeling binary responses by using cross-sectional data has been addressed with a number of satisfying solutions that draw on both parametric and nonparametric methods. However, there exist many real situations where one of the two responses (usually the most interesting for the analysis) is rare. It has been largely reported that this class imbalance heavily compromises the process of learning, because the model tends to focus on the prevalent class and to ignore the rare events. However, not only the estimation of the classification model is affected by a skewed distribution of the classes, but also the evaluation of its accuracy is jeopardized, because the scarcity of data leads to poor estimates of the model's accuracy. In this work, the effects of class imbalance on model training and model assessing are discussed. Moreover, a unified and systematic framework for dealing with the problem of imbalanced classification is proposed, based on a smoothed bootstrap re-sampling technique. The proposed technique is founded on a sound theoretical basis and an extensive empirical study shows that it outperforms the main other remedies to face imbalanced learning problems.",

Notes:
    * It is not entirely clear if the authors propose kernel density estimation         or the fitting of simple multivariate Gaussians on the minority samples.         The latter seems to be more likely, I implement that approach.

    * It is not specified how to do the evaluation.

Notes:
    * Evolving both majority and minority probabilities as nothing ensures that the probabilities remain in the range [0,1], and they need to be normalized.
    * The inversely weighted function needs to be cut at some value (like the alpha level), otherwise it will overemphasize the utility of having differing neighbors next to each other.

Notes:
    * This method has a lot of parameters, it becomes fairly hard to cross-validate thoroughly.
    * Fails if matrix is singular when computing alpha_star, fixed by PCA.
    * Singularity might be caused by repeating samples.
    * Maintaining the kernel matrix becomes unfeasible above a couple of thousand vectors.

Existing synthetic oversampling do suffer from the curse of dimensionality because they rely heavily on Euclidean distance. This paper proposed a new method, called Minority Oversampling Technique based on Local Densities in Low-Dimensional Space (or MOT2LD in short). MOT2LD first maps each training sample into a low-dimensional space, and makes clustering of their low-dimensional representations. It then assigns weight to each minority sample as the product of two quantities: local minority density and local majority count, indicating its importance of sampling. The synthetic minority class samples are generated inside some minority cluster. MOT2LD has been evaluated on 15 real-world data sets. The experimental results have shown that our method outperforms some other existing methods including SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN, and MWMOTE, in terms of G-mean and F-measure.",

Notes:
    * Clusters might contain 1 elements, and all points can be filtered as noise.
    * Clusters might contain 0 elements as well, if all points are filtered as noise.
    * The entire clustering can become empty.
    * TSNE is very slow when the number of instances is over a couple of 1000

In order to address this problem several methods for oversampling the minority class have been proposed. Oversampling methods generate synthetic objects for the minority class in order to balance the amount of objects between classes, among them, SMOTE is one of the most successful and well-known methods. In this paper, we introduce a modification of SMOTE which deterministically generates synthetic objects for the minority class. Our proposed method eliminates the random component of SMOTE and generates different amount of synthetic objects for each object of the minority class. An experimental comparison of the proposed method against SMOTE in standard imbalanced datasets is provided. The experimental results show an improvement of our proposed method regarding SMOTE, in terms of F-measure.",

Notes:
    * I find the description of the technique a bit confusing, especially on the bounds of the search space of velocities and positions. Equations 15 and 16 specify the lower and upper bounds, the lower bound is in fact a vector while the upper bound is a distance. I tried to implement something meaningful.
    * I also find the setting of accelerating constant 2.0 strange, most of the time the velocity will be bounded due to this choice. 
    * Also, training and predicting probabilities with a non-linear SVM as the evaluation function becomes fairly expensive when the number of training vectors reaches a couple of thousands. To reduce computational burden, minority and majority vectors far from the other class are removed to reduce the size of both classes to a maximum of 500 samples. Generally, this shouldn't really affect the results as the technique focuses on the samples near the class boundaries.

Synthetic oversampling techniques address this problem by creating synthetic minority samples to balance the data set. However, most of these techniques may create wrong synthetic minority samples which fall inside majority regions. In this respect, this paper presents a novel Cluster Based Synthetic Oversampling (CBSO) algorithm. CBSO adopts its basic idea from existing synthetic oversampling techniques and incorporates unsupervised clustering in its synthetic data generation mechanism. CBSO ensures that synthetic samples created via this method always lie inside minority regions and thus, avoids any wrong synthetic sample creation. Simualtion analyses on some real world datasets show the effectiveness of CBSO showing improvements in various assesment metrics such as overall accuracy, F-measure, and G-mean.",

Notes:
    * This technique is basically unreproducible. I try to implement something following the idea of applying some simple genetic algorithm for optimization.
    * In my best understanding, the technique uses evolutionary algorithms to for feature selection and then applies vanilla SMOTE on the selected features only.

A trivial classifier typically fails to detect a minority class due to its extremely low incidence rate. In this paper, a new over-sampling technique called DBSMOTE is proposed. Our technique relies on a density-based notion of clusters and is designed to over-sample an arbitrarily shaped cluster discovered by DBSCAN. DBSMOTE generates synthetic instances along a shortest path from each positive instance to a pseudo-centroid of a minority-class cluster. Consequently, these synthetic instances are dense near this centroid and are sparse far from this centroid. Our experimental results show that DBSMOTE improves precision, F-value, and AUC more effectively than SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, and Safe-Level-SMOTE for imbalanced datasets.",

Notes:
    * Standardization is needed to use absolute eps values.
    * The clustering is likely to identify all instances as noise, fixed by recursive call with increaseing eps.

Notes:
    * The method is highly inefficient when the number of minority samples is high, time complexity is O(n^3), with 1000 minority samples it takes about 1e9 objective function evaluations to find 1 new sample points. Adding 1000 samples would take about 1e12 evaluations of the objective function, which is unfeasible. We introduce a new parameter, n_step, and during the search for the new sample at most n_step combinations of minority samples are tried.
    * Abnormality of minority points is defined in the paper as D_maj/D_min, high abnormality  means that the minority point is close to other minority points and very far from majority points. This is definitely not abnormality, I have implemented the opposite. 
    * Nothing ensures that the fisher statistics and the variance from the geometric mean remain comparable, which might skew the optimization towards one of the sub-objectives.
    * MinMax normalization doesn't work, each attribute will have a 0 value, which will make the geometric mean of all attribute 0.

We adjust the sampling times to search for the optimal results while maintain the dataset size unchanged.

The fact that one of the classes is underrepresented in the data set is not the only reason of difficulties. The complex distribution of data, especially small disjuncts, noise and class overlapping, contributes to the significant depletion of classifier's performance. Hence, the numerous solutions were proposed. They are categorized into three groups: data-level techniques, algorithm-level methods and cost-sensitive approaches. This paper presents a novel data-level method combining Versatile Improved SMOTE and rough sets. The algorithm was applied to the two-class problems, data sets were characterized by the nominal attributes. We evaluated the proposed technique in comparison with other preprocessing methods. The impact of the additional cleaning phase was specifically verified.",

                    abstract="The classification of imbalanced data has been recognized as a crucial problem in machine learning and data mining. In an imbalanced dataset, there are significantly fewer training instances of one class compared to another class. Hence, the minority class instances are much more likely to be misclassified. In the literature, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) has been developed to deal with the classification of imbalanced datasets. It synthesizes new samples of the minority class to balance the dataset, by re-sampling the instances of the minority class. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms-based SMOTE uses the same sampling rate for all instances of the minority class. This results in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based SMOTE (GASMOTE) algorithm. The GASMOTE algorithm uses different sampling rates for different minority class instances and finds the combination of optimal sampling rates. The experimental results on ten typical imbalance datasets show that, compared with SMOTE algorithm, GASMOTE can increase 5.9{\%} on F-measure value and 1.6{\%} on G-mean value, and compared with Borderline-SMOTE algorithm, GASMOTE can increase 3.7{\%} on F-measure value and 2.3{\%} on G-mean value. GASMOTE can be used as a new over-sampling technique to deal with imbalance dataset classification problem. We have particularly applied the GASMOTE algorithm to a practical engineering application: prediction of rockburst in the VCR rockburst datasets. The experiment results indicate that the GASMOTE algorithm can accurately predict the rockburst occurrence and hence provides guidance to the design and construction of safe deep mining engineering structures.",

Notes:
    * Unlucky setting of parameters might result 0 points added, we have fixed this by increasing the gamma_S threshold if the number of samples accepted is low.
    * Similarly, unlucky setting of parameters might result all majority samples turned into minority.
    * In my opinion, in the algorithm presented in the paper the relations are incorrect. The authors talk about accepting samples having POS score below a threshold, and in the algorithm in both places POS >= gamma is used.

Notes:
    * It is not clear how the kappa threshold is used, I do use the RA score to drive all the evolution. Particularly:
        
        "In the last phase of each iteration, the average Kappa value
        in current non-inferior set is compare with the latest threshold
        value, the threshold is then increase further if the average value
        increases, and vice versa. By doing so, the non-inferior region will
        be progressively reduced as the Kappa threshold lifts up."
    
    I don't see why would the Kappa threshold lift up if the kappa thresholds
    are decreased if the average Kappa decreases ("vice versa").

    * Due to the interpretation of kappa threshold and the lack of detailed description of the SIS process, the implementation is not exactly what is described in the paper, but something very similar.

The SMOTE is a famous oversampling technique generating synthetic minority samples by linear interpolation between adjacent minorities. However, it becomes inefficiency for datasets with sparse distributions. In this paper, we propose the Stochastic Sensitivity Oversampling (SSO) which generates synthetic samples following Gaussian distributions in the Q-union of minority samples. The Q-union is the union of Q-neighborhoods (hypercubes centered at minority samples) and such that new samples are synthesized around minority samples. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well on most of datasets, especially those with a sparse distribution.",

Notes:
    * It is not entirely clear why J-1 output is supposed where J is the number of classes.
    * The fitness function is changed to a balanced mean loss, as I found that it just ignores classification on minority samples (class label +1) in the binary case.
    * The iRprop+ optimization is not implemented.
    * The original paper proposes using SMOTE incrementally. Instead of that, this implementation applies SMOTE to generate all samples needed in the sampling epochs and the evolution of RBF networks is used to select the sampling providing the best results.

                    abstract = {Protein-nucleotide interactions are ubiquitous in a wide variety of biological processes. Accurately identifying interaction residues solely from protein sequences is useful for both protein function annotation and drug design, especially in the post-genomic era, as large volumes of protein data have not been functionally annotated. Protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction is a typical imbalanced learning problem, where binding residues are extremely fewer in number than non-binding residues. Alleviating the severity of class imbalance has been demonstrated to be a promising means of improving the prediction performance of a machine-learning-based predictor for class imbalance problems. However, little attention has been paid to the negative impact of class imbalance on protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction. In this study, we propose a new supervised over-sampling algorithm that synthesizes additional minority class samples to address class imbalance. The experimental results from protein-nucleotide interaction datasets demonstrate that the proposed supervised over-sampling algorithm can relieve the severity of class imbalance and help to improve prediction performance. Based on the proposed over-sampling algorithm, a predictor, called TargetSOS, is implemented for protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction. Cross-validation tests and independent validation tests demonstrate the effectiveness of TargetSOS.

However, in many real-life applications, this assumption is grossly violated. Often, the ratios of prior probabilities between classes are extremely skewed. This situation is known as the class imbalance problem. One of the strategies to tackle this problem consists of balancing the classes by resampling the original data set. The SMOTE algorithm is probably the most popular technique to increase the size of the minority class by generating synthetic instances. From the idea of the original SMOTE, we here propose the use of three approaches to surrounding neighborhood with the aim of generating artificial minority instances, but taking into account both the proximity and the spatial distribution of the examples. Experiments over a large collection of databases and using three different classifiers demonstrate that the new surrounding neighborhood-based SMOTE procedures significantly outperform other existing over-sampling algorithms.",

The goal of this class is to provide a functionality to send data through
on any model selection/evaluation pipeline with no oversampling carried
out. It can be used to get baseline estimates on preformance.
